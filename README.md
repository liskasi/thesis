This repository is part of the Bachelor's paper.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains three folders, each dedicated to a different similarity measure (Cosine, Pearson, Jaccard). Each folder includes algorithms for two methods: k-Nearest Neighbors and SVD-based approaches. 

All algorithms already include testing that splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate effectiveness scores.

### Folders and Contents

1. **Folder 1: Cosine**
    - `neighbourhoodBased.py`: kNN-based algorithm implementation.
    - `svdBased.py`: SVD-based algorithm implementation.

2. **Folder 2: Jaccard**
    - `neighbourhoodBased.py`: kNN-based algorithm implementation.
    - `svdBased.py`: SVD-based algorithm implementation.

3. **Folder 3: Pearson**
    - `neighbourhoodBased2.py`: kNN-based algorithm implementation.
    - `svdBased.py`: SVD-based algorithm implementation.

### Baseline Algorithm

- `top5.py`: A baseline scenario algorithm that selects the five most popular items, recommends them to users, and calculates the performance score.

### SQL queries

- `console.sql`: All sql queries used during project development.
